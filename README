PITS - Tracker software for the PITS board, for use in High Altitude Ballooning.

Created by Dave Akerman (dave@daveakerman.com)

This software is written for the Raspberry Pi model A+, B+ or V2 B,
with the Pi In The Sky (PITS+) board from http://ava.upuaut.net/store/.
Also works with the model A or B Pi and the earlier PITS board.

Software support is provided for customers who have
purchased a PITS or PITS+ board, for use with that board only.

CHANGE LOG
==========

18/08/2015

- Merged in LoRa code (LoRa branch is now defunct)
- Photographs can now be taken at independent rates for RTTY, LoRa, full-size
- Landing prediction option
- Fixes for multiple DS18B20 sensors
- Ability to run emulated flight from GPS NMEA file
- Ability to modify SSDV images before transmission using ImageMagick etc.
- LoRa Calling Mode
- RTTY serial port kept open continuously
- Startup radio message with IP address etc.
- Stop multiple tracker programs from being run
- Test for latest Pi board
- Option to delete existing image files at startup
- Image files now in names/dated folders e.g. /home/pi/images/RTTY/18_08_2015

17/06/2015

- Merged in APRS code (APRS branch is now defunct)
- Added options to control when APRS packets are sent
- Fixed issue with tracker program failing SD card is pulled and APRS enabled
- NTX2 frequency-setting code now has same improvements as for MTX2
- Serial port kept open now instead of open/close each packet; using flush command to sync instead of closing.  This allows ...
- ... Telemetry log entries now written whilst waiting for telemetry to Tx; removes/reduces delay due to SD card writing.

01/06/2015

- MTX2 frequency-setting code changed to fix random fails to set frequency
- logging now on by default
- log files removed from repository
- Long payload IDs are truncated to 6 before passing to SSDV program
- SSDV image widths and heights now forced to be multiples of 16 pixels
- Added support for second (external) DS18B20 temperature sensor
- Fix to occassional missing packets
- Support for Pi V2 B
- Protect against BMP085/180 being disconnected after initialisation

19/12/2014

- GPS code completely re-written to use WiringPi library instead of bcm library
- default configuration now leaves the monitor on, to ease development
- As the PITS+ boards are set by frequency in MHz, but the earlier board was
  set by channel number, the code now accepts either "frequency=nn" for channel
  number, of frequency=xxx.xxxMHz for actual frequency.  Not that using the
  second form does not give you more options on the older board - the frequency
  will be set to the closest channnel.
- Camera filenames are now the system time
- Camera images are now saved in dated folders
